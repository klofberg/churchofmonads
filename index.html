<pre>
In the beginning there were functions
And the functions were pure
Though in the darkness, side effects lingered, raising exceptions, threatening idempotency
But the Good Lord did not falter.
He said the word: Let there be Monads
Let all functions which are pure be lifted
Let all which is impure be bound.
Begone, impurities, into the abyss of the resolver!
And the functions were pure, and the code was clean.
